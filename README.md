## My process
- planning
- basic html structure
- basic CSS styling including preliminary positioning of background images
- stats styling
- text styling
- final background image positioning (mobile and desktop)
- finishing touches


### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

More about background image positioning. 
Tried a table solution for the stats presentation in the first round, but in the end found Grid more useful for the amount of control over the element that I wanted.


### Continued development

More about positioning - both background and foreground. In certain cases definitely trickier than you might think at first glance. Control is key.
